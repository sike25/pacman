Some solutions to the UC Berkeley Pac-Man Projects    
https://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

### ghostbusters
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pac-Man world. I implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

### reinforcement
The implementations of value iteration, classic Q-learning, epsilon-greedy and approximate Q learning. Adjusting noise, living reward and the discount factor to influence behavior given an optimal policy.

### capture the flag
The Pac-Man contest is an open-ended project in which student agents compete directly against each other in a capture-the-flag style multi-player variant of Pac-Man. We use state-space search, adversarial search, and probabilistic tracking.
